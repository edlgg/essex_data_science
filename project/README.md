## Data Science Project README

THe UTC.py file in the root directory is used to compare versions of agents. You can pass the path to the agents you want to compare as arguments. Agents are stores in storage.

Storage has the different agents we trained. In the classifiers directory within one of the versions in storage we can see the different versions of the classifiers and in datasets the data to train them each time. UTC.py is the code ran to run the training process.

Files has the pdfs associated with the project
